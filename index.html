            <p>He claimed that the team had trained in India during the past two years and had made some important moves in the last three weeks.</p>
            <p>Kumar said the team could start the second half and then go over to New Delhi to finish off the series.</p>
            <p>"It will cost 100 to 200 million rupees (US$60,000), (but) I don't know about that per person but we will start the next two with 10, 25, 60 million rupees, while the remaining 20-30 million will be paid for by the country. The team should be happy and we are happy," said Kumar.</p>
